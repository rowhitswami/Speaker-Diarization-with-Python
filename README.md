# Speaker-Diarization-with-Python

## What is Speaker Diarization?
**Speaker diarisation (or diarization) is the process of partitioning an input audio stream into homogeneous segments according to the speaker identity.**
It can enhance the readability of an automatic speech transcription by structuring the audio stream into speaker turns and, when used together with speaker recognition systems, by providing the speakerâ€™s true identity.

## Why Speaker Diarization?
The diarization task is a necessary pre-processing step for speaker identification or speech transcription when there is more than one speaker in an audio/video recording. 
For each speaker in a recording, it consists of detecting the time areas where he or she speaks. Each time area, corresponding to a segment, is annotated with an abstract label representing the speaker. Thus, **the diarization task allows to determine who spoke when.**


## Methods Involved in Diarization:
1. **Speaker segmentation** : It aims at finding speaker change points in an audio stream.
2. **Speaker clustering** : It aims at grouping together speech segments on the basis of speaker characteristics.


## Applications:
* Broadcast News(TV and Radio)
* Call center Data analysis
* Medical records: Doctor vs Patient Speech Separation
* Automatic notes generation for Meetings
